# User  Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

### Description

This is a static frontend only website project created using HTML and CSS
as part of a Full Stack Web Development course of which I am currenty enrolled.
The project is based on the skills I have obtained from the completion 
of three course modules (HTML, CSS and User Centric Frontend Development).

### Brief

The project involved the creation of a website for a band with over 50 years 
experience to cater for existing and any potential new fans. 
Pictures of the band members, four audio clips and a video clip were supplied 
for the website.
Another requirement was an announcement of the band's availability for hire 
which was to be included on the site and to also highlight their social 
media presence.

### Layout and Features

In preperation for the project I created user stories and also drew up wireframe 
mockups for the layout of the site using the the Balsamiq wireframe tool.
During the development, three main colors were chosen for the color 
scheme the site is based on.

The website was created with a mobile first approach in mind, also with 
user experience being top priority, the layout is based on a single scrolling page 
which consists of the home page and five seperate page areas. 
All the pages are accessed through the fixed navigation bar links at the 
top of the page.

The homepage consists of a full page image of the band with a fixed navigation bar 
situated at the top of the page. The band logo, social media links and an image 
link to the events page are situated at the bottom of the home page.

The following five seperate page areas consist of a Band bio page which includes images 
and a short description of the band members, an Events page highlighting tour 
dates, tickets and venues, a Media page containing the supplied audio and video 
clips, a News page with band news content and finally a Contact page which 
outlines options for booking the band to play at events.

### Technologies 

The main technologies which are used for the navigation and layout of the website 
are based on the Bootstrap grid system.
The foundation of each page is structured on Bootstraps containers, rows and 
columns.

The use of the Bootstrap grid system also results in a fully responsive 
website allowing it to adapt to various devices and screen sizes. 
Some of the buttons and lists used on the site are also utilised from Bootstrap. 

Jquery and Bootstrap Javascript were also included to activate the hamburger button 
drop down menu which contains the website navigation links for devices equipped 
with smaller screens.
Google fonts were utilised for the two font styles used on the site.

Social media link logos, which make use of Font Awesome, were also added 
to the home page and footer. 

Apart from the aforementioned technologies, all the HTML and CSS code was 
implemented by myself using the knowledge and guidance I have so far received 
from the course.

### Testing

The usability and responsiveness of the website was tested by deploying it on 
Github pages and viewing it on various different browsers, devices and screen 
sizes.
