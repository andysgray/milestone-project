# User centric frontend development milestone project

This is a static frontend only website project created using HTML and CSS
as part of a Full Stack Web Development course of which I am currenty enrolled.
The project is based on the skills I have obtained from the completion 
of three modules (HTML, CSS and User Centric Frontend Development).

The website was created for a band with over 50 years experience wishing to cater for 
existing and potential new fans. 
Band member pictures, four audio clips and a video clip was supplied for the website.
The band also require the site to announce their availability for hire and also to 
highlight their social media presence.

In preperation for the project I created user stories and also drew up wireframe mockups
for the layout of the site using the Balsamiq wireframe tool.

The website is based on a single scrolling page which consists of the home page
and five seperate page areas, which are also accessed to through the 
fixed navigation bar links at the top of the page.
The pages consist of a band bio section, an events section highlighting tour dates and 
venues, a media section containing the supplied audio and video clips, a news 
section and finally a contact section.

Google fonts links were utilised for the two different font styles used on the site.
The main navigation and site layout is based on the Bootstrap grid system,
and is also fully responsive in order to adapt to different screen sizes. 
Jquery script links were also added to enable the hamburger drop down
menu  for smaller screens.

The websites usability and responsiveness was tested by deploying it on Github 
pages and viewing it on various different devices and screen sizes.
