# User  Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

### Description

This is a static frontend only website project created using HTML and CSS
as part of a Full Stack Web Development course of which I am currenty enrolled.
The project is based on the skills I have obtained from the completion 
of three course modules (HTML, CSS and User Centric Frontend Development).

### Brief

The project involved the creation of a website for a band with over 50 years 
experience to cater for existing and any potential new fans. 
Pictures of the band members, four audio clips and a video clip were supplied for the website.
Another requirement was an announcement of the band's availability for hire which was to be
included on the site and to also highlight their social media presence.

### Layout and Features

In preperation for the project I created user stories and also drew up wireframe mockups
for the layout of the site using the Balsamiq wireframe tool.

With user experience top priority, the website is based on a single scrolling page 
which consists of the home page and five seperate page areas. The pages can also be 
accessed through the fixed navigation bar links at the top of the page.
The five seperate page areas consist of a band bio page which includes images and a short description 
of the band members, an events page highlighting tour dates, tickets and venues, 
a media page containing the supplied audio and video clips, a news page with 
band news content and finally a contact page which outlines options for booking the band 
to play at events.
Social media links were also added to the navigation bar and footer. 

### Technologies 

The main technologies which are used for the website navigation and layout are 
based on the Bootstrap grid system.
Each page is structured around Bootstraps containers, rows and columns.
The use of the Bootstrap grid system also results in a fully responsive 
website allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes. 
Jquery and Bootstrap Javascript were also added to activate the hamburger drop down 
menu which contain the website navigation links for devices equipped with smaller screens.
Google fonts were utilised for the two different font styles used on the site.

### Testing

The usability and responsiveness of the website was tested by deploying it on Github 
pages and viewing it on various different browsers, devices and sreen sizes.
